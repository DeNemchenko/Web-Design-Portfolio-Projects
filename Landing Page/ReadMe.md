# FEND Project #4: Landing Page
## Overview
### _Utilizing JavaScript to make dynamic experience_

The **Landing Page** is the fourth project of Udacity [Frontend Web Development Fundamentals](https://emc.udacity.com/c/oneten-scholarship/catalog/Ps0S9U5suW8IHily/i/nd/nd0011-oneten-p1) nanodegree program. 
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

Methods used:
- Creating new elements just like the top menu and its styles.
- Editing styles and functionality for activated and deactivated elements.
- Automatic scrolling on-click.

## Features

- A Dynamically created navigation menu on the header, and no matter how many sections will be added in `index.html`, the menu will adapt automatically.
- The page automatically scrolls to the desired section when you click on its peer on the navigation menu.
- The activated section and its peer on the navigation menu change their styles in order to exhibit their active status.
- The previous activated section and its peer return to their original style.

## Built With

- The original `index.html` and `css/styles.css` are provided by [Udacity].
- The original `index.html` provided by [Udacity] has 3 sections and 1 section was added to test the functionality of automatically adding new navigation menu items.
- All other development features are done in `js/app.js`.
